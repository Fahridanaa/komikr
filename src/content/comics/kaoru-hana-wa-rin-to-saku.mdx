synopsis: In a certain place, there are two neighboring high schools. Chidori High School, a bottom-feeder boys school where idiots gather, and Kikyo Girls School, a well-established girls school. Rintaro Tsumugi, a strong and quiet second year student at Chidori High School, meets Kaoruko Wakuri, a girl who comes as a customer while helping out at his familys cake shop. Rintaro feels comfortable spending time with Kaoruko, but she is a student at Kikyo Girls, a neighboring school that thoroughly dislikes Chidori High. This is the story of two people who are so close and yet so far apart.
